    "- **Question 1:** What demographics of people are more likely to be homeless today?\n",

    "- **Question 3:** What are the primary factors correlated with homelessness in Chapel Hill/NC and how do they vary by race, gender, etc. Do these differ from nationwide trends?\n",

    "- **Question 5:** How do individual CoCs compare in terms of change in homeless counts over the years?\n",
    "- **Question 6:** What trends do we see in racial segregation?\n",
    "- **Question 7:** How has the demographics of the homeless population changed over time and are there notable changes in the number of homeless in specific over time?\n",
    "- **Question 8:** Can we predict future trends in homelessness count based on historical data? What kind of model would best suit that?\n",
    "- **Question 9:** How do the demographics of homelessness compare to the general population?\n",
    "- **Question 10:** How has COVID affected housing stability for different demographic groups?"
